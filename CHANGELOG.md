# CHANGELOG

## Release 1.1.0

Initially this module was part of my own system and I choose to split it to let other benefit from it.

During the split, I failed to see that clas overrides will be badly seen by most. Error fixed!

No more overrides on the Card class. And the two other ones can be removed by settings without loosing much from the functionnalities.

More details in the `README`, section `Invasive code - or not`
