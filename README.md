# Ready To Use Cards Module

## Introduction

> You don't need to edit your card deck inside the game. Once set, you only need to have easy acces to your cards and the related decks and discard piles.

> When adding this module, it will automatically creates two card stacks for each players. One designed to store his hand. Those cards are hidden from other players. The other one is designed to store revealed cards the player has revealed to the other ones.

> Laslty, it replace the classic card GUI by a unified one
